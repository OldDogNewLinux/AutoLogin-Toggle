# AutoLogin-Toggle

2024-10-18 

A lot of people including myself are looking for a simple solution for enabling or disabling autologin for Linux,
particularly for the XFCE desktop environment using the LightDM login interface.
Necessity is the mother of invention. So here it is. 

This script will add an application to the System Manager that allows you to Enable and Disable Automatic Login 
on an XFCE desktop using the LightDM login manager.


Enjoy!
